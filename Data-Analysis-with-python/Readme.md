# Course Title: Data Analysis in Python

Welcome to the **Data Analysis in Python** repository! This course is designed to guide you through the essential steps of performing data analysis, from importing datasets and wrangling data to building and refining predictive models. By the end of this course, you will have the skills to take a real dataset, explore it, preprocess it, build a regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Module 1: Importing and Exploring Data

In this module, you will learn how to understand data and leverage Python libraries to import data from multiple sources. You will explore fundamental tasks to begin analyzing the data you have imported.

### Learning Objectives
- **Access databases using Python database APIs**  
- **Analyze Python data using a dataset**  
- **Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses**  
- **Read data using Python's Pandas package**  
- **Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python**  

**Key Topics**  
- Introduction to Python database APIs  
- Overview of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib  
- Reading various data formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases)  
- Basic data exploration and summary statistics

## Module 2: Data Wrangling

This module focuses on fundamental data wrangling tasks, which collectively form the preprocessing phase of data analysis. These tasks include handling missing values, formatting data to achieve consistency, normalizing data, creating bins, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

### Learning Objectives
- **Describe how to handle missing values**  
- **Describe data formatting techniques**  
- **Describe data normalization and standardization**  
- **Demonstrate the use of binning**  
- **Demonstrate the use of categorical variables**  

**Key Topics**  
- Detecting and handling missing data (drop, fill with mean/median/mode)  
- Converting data types and reformatting columns  
- Normalizing and standardizing data  
- Binning continuous data into categories  
- Encoding categorical variables (one-hot encoding)

## Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, you will learn what is meant by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how to calculate key descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, and quartile values) to better understand data distribution. You will also learn methods for grouping and visualizing data, as well as correlation techniques like Pearson correlation and the Chi-square test.

### Learning Objectives
- **Implement descriptive statistics**  
- **Demonstrate the basics of grouping**  
- **Describe data correlation processes**  

**Key Topics**  
- Central tendencies (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (variance, standard deviation)  
- Grouping data for deeper insights  
- Pearson correlation for continuous variables  
- Chi-square test for categorical variables  
- Data visualization techniques (box plots, histograms, scatter plots)

## Module 4: Regression Models

In this module, you will learn to define explanatory and response variables, and you will see the differences between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. You will also learn how to evaluate a model using visualizations and how to interpret polynomial regression. Additionally, you will learn about R-squared and mean square error (MSE) measures for in-sample evaluations.

### Learning Objectives
- **Evaluate a model using visualization techniques in Python**  
- **Apply polynomial regression techniques using Python**  
- **Transform data into a polynomial, then use linear regression to fit the parameter**  
- **Apply model evaluation using visualization in Python**  
- **Apply polynomial regression techniques in Python**  
- **Predict and make decisions based on Python data models**  
- **Describe the use of R-squared and MSE for in-sample evaluation**  
- **Define the term "curvilinear relationship"**  

**Key Topics**  
- Simple vs. multiple linear regression  
- Polynomial regression and pipelines  
- In-sample evaluation (R-squared, MSE)  
- Model visualization (residual plots, regression plots)

## Module 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

This module covers the importance of model evaluation and refinement. You will learn about model selection, identifying overfitting/underfitting, and how to use **Ridge Regression** to regularize and reduce standard errors. You will also learn about the **Grid Search** method to tune hyperparameters of your regression model.

### Learning Objectives
- **Describe data model refinement techniques**  
- **Explain overfitting, underfitting, and model selection**  
- **Apply ridge regression to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid overfitting a regression model**  
- **Apply grid search techniques using Python**  
- **Explain how grid searches work**  
- **Describe how ridge regression works to avoid overfitting a model**  

**Key Topics**  
- Overfitting vs. underfitting  
- Bias-variance trade-off  
- Ridge regression and L2 regularization  
- Grid search for hyperparameter tuning  
- Cross-validation for model selection

## Module 6: Final Assignment

Congratulations! You have completed all the learning modules for this course. In this final module, you will work on a project to demonstrate the skills you have gained. You will assume the role of a **Data Analyst** at a real estate investment trust organization. Given a dataset containing detailed house price information, your task is to analyze and predict market prices based on property features.

### Learning Objectives
- **Write Python code to import data sets into a DataFrame**  
- **Generate appropriate Python code to wrangle data**  
- **Create boxplots and scatter plots using Python**  
- **Calculate R-squared and MSE using Python**  
- **Evaluate different data models by splitting data into training and testing sets**  
- **Perform polynomial transformation on data sets**  

**Key Tasks**  
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**: Import the housing dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand key features.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform, normalize, or encode features as necessary.  
4. **Model Building**: Compare multiple regression models (linear, polynomial, ridge).
