## 1: Importing and Exploring Data

In this module, you will learn how to understand data and leverage Python libraries to import data from multiple sources. You will explore fundamental tasks to begin analyzing the data you have imported.

### Learning Objectives
- **Access databases using Python database APIs**  
- **Analyze Python data using a dataset**  
- **Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses**  
- **Read data using Python's Pandas package**  
- **Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python**  

### Key Topics & Theory

1. **Python Database APIs**  
   - A Database API is a standardized way to connect to databases in Python. Libraries like `sqlite3`, `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL), or `mysql-connector-python` make it easy to fetch or update data using SQL commands.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Direct database access allows you to retrieve large datasets, filter them at the database level, and only import the data you need into Python.

2. **Analyze Data with Python**  
   - **NumPy** provides efficient array operations, making it easier to handle numerical computations.  
   - **Pandas** offers DataFrame structures that let you manipulate data in rows and columns.  
   - **Matplotlib** allows for data visualization through plots and charts.  
   - **Why It Matters**: These libraries form the core ecosystem for data analysis in Python and allow for quick, powerful manipulation and visualization of data.

3. **Importing and Exporting Data**  
   - **Reading CSV**: `pd.read_csv("filename.csv")`  
   - **Reading Excel**: `pd.read_excel("filename.xlsx")`  
   - **SQL Queries**: Use the appropriate connector to read data with `pd.read_sql_query("SELECT ...", connection)`.  
   - **Exporting**: Save your results as CSV, Excel, JSON, etc., with `DataFrame.to_csv("output.csv")` or `DataFrame.to_excel("output.xlsx")`.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Being able to handle multiple file formats ensures flexibility and portability of data.

4. **Basic Data Exploration**  
   - Once you have your data in a Pandas DataFrame, functions like `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()` give you quick insights into the structure and statistical properties of your dataset.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Quick checks help identify data inconsistencies, missing values, and possible outliers early in the analysis.

## 2: Data Wrangling

This module focuses on fundamental data wrangling tasks, which collectively form the preprocessing phase of data analysis. These tasks include handling missing values, formatting data to achieve consistency, normalizing data, creating bins, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

### Learning Objectives
- **Describe how to handle missing values**  
- **Describe data formatting techniques**  
- **Describe data normalization and standardization**  
- **Demonstrate the use of binning**  
- **Demonstrate the use of categorical variables**  

### Key Topics & Theory

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - **Dropping Rows/Columns**: Removing rows or columns with too many missing entries (`df.dropna()`).
   - **Imputation**: Filling missing values with a computed value like mean, median, or mode (`df.fillna(df.mean())`).
   - **Why It Matters**: Missing data can skew analysis and reduce predictive model accuracy. Careful handling ensures the integrity of your dataset.

2. **Data Formatting**
   - **Consistency**: Standardizing units (e.g., converting all temperatures to Celsius) or merging multiple date columns into a single standardized format.
   - **Data Types**: Converting columns to appropriate data types (integer, float, string, datetime) to ensure correct operations.
   - **Why It Matters**: Consistent and correctly typed data is crucial for reliable computations and for merging/joining data from different sources.

3. **Normalization and Standardization**
   - **Normalization**: Often transforms data to a [0,1] range.
   - **Standardization**: Transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   - **Why It Matters**: Many machine learning algorithms (especially those based on distance metrics or gradient-based optimization) assume that data is on a similar scale.

4. **Binning**
   - Converting continuous values into discrete intervals (bins). For example, grouping ages into `[0-18], [19-35], [36-60], 60+`.
   - **Why It Matters**: Binning can help transform noisy continuous data into more interpretable categories.

5. **Categorical Variables**
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categories into dummy/indicator variables (`pd.get_dummies(df["Category"])`).
   - **Label Encoding**: Assigning numerical labels to categories (often used in tree-based algorithms).
   - **Why It Matters**: Many algorithms can’t directly handle text-based categories. Encoding them numerically is essential for most modeling techniques.

## 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, you will learn what is meant by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how to calculate key descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, and quartile values) to better understand data distribution. You will also learn methods for grouping and visualizing data, as well as correlation techniques like Pearson correlation and the Chi-square test.

### Learning Objectives
- **Implement descriptive statistics**  
- **Demonstrate the basics of grouping**  
- **Describe data correlation processes**  

### Key Topics & Theory

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Mean, Median, Mode**: Central tendency measures.
   - **Variance, Standard Deviation, Range**: Dispersion measures, which indicate how spread out the data is.
   - **Why It Matters**: Understanding the distribution of each feature helps spot trends, outliers, and anomalies.

2. **Grouping Data**
   - **GroupBy Operations**: Summarizing data by categories (e.g., average sales per region).
   - **Pivot Tables**: Restructuring data for multi-dimensional analysis.
   - **Why It Matters**: Grouping reveals deeper relationships within subsets of your data.

3. **Correlation Techniques**
   - **Pearson Correlation**: Measures linear relationship between two continuous variables (`df.corr()`).
   - **Chi-square Test**: Assesses the association between two categorical variables.
   - **Why It Matters**: Knowing how variables relate to each other helps in feature selection and in identifying potential causes-and-effects or confounders.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - **Box Plots**: Show the distribution of data and highlight outliers.  
   - **Histograms**: Show frequency distribution of a numeric variable.  
   - **Scatter Plots**: Show potential relationships or trends between two variables.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Visual representations often reveal insights not immediately apparent from raw numerical output.

## 4: Regression Models

In this module, you will learn to define explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables, and you will see the differences between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. You will also learn how to evaluate a model using visualizations and interpret polynomial regression. Additionally, you will learn about R-squared and mean square error (MSE) measures for in-sample evaluations.

### Learning Objectives
- **Evaluate a model using visualization techniques in Python**  
- **Apply polynomial regression techniques using Python**  
- **Transform data into a polynomial, then use linear regression to fit the parameter**  
- **Apply model evaluation using visualization in Python**  
- **Apply polynomial regression techniques in Python**  
- **Predict and make decisions based on Python data models**  
- **Describe the use of R-squared and MSE for in-sample evaluation**  
- **Define the term "curvilinear relationship"**  

### Key Topics & Theory

1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one explanatory variable and one response variable.  
     \[
       y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
     \]
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves multiple explanatory variables.
   - **Why It Matters**: Linear models are a foundational technique for understanding how changes in one or more independent variables affect a continuous dependent variable.

2. **Polynomial Regression**
   - **Polynomial Features**: Non-linear transformation of an input variable \( x \) (e.g., \( x^2, x^3 \), etc.) that allows for a “curvilinear” relationship.
   - **Why It Matters**: Real-world relationships are often non-linear. Polynomial regression helps capture this curvature.

3. **Model Evaluation (R-squared & MSE)**
   - **R-squared**: Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. Ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of the squares of the errors, indicating how much predictions deviate from actual values.
   - **Why It Matters**: These metrics quantify how well your model performs, guiding improvements and comparisons.

4. **Visualization Techniques**  
   - **Residual Plots**: Show the difference between predicted and actual values, helping identify bias or patterns left in the data.
   - **Regression Plots**: Display the regression line or curve fit against your data points, aiding in interpreting the model’s predictions.

## 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

This module covers the importance of model evaluation and refinement. You will learn about model selection, identifying overfitting/underfitting, and how to use **Ridge Regression** to regularize and reduce standard errors. You will also learn about the **Grid Search** method to tune hyperparameters of your regression model.

### Learning Objectives
- **Describe data model refinement techniques**  
- **Explain overfitting, underfitting, and model selection**  
- **Apply ridge regression to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid overfitting a regression model**  
- **Apply grid search techniques using Python**  
- **Explain how grid searches work**  
- **Describe how ridge regression works to avoid overfitting a model**  

### Key Topics & Theory

1. **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**
   - **Overfitting**: The model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize to new data.
   - **Underfitting**: The model is too simplistic and fails to capture the underlying trend of the data.
   - **Why It Matters**: A good model strikes a balance (the bias-variance trade-off).

2. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**
   - **Penalizes** large coefficients by adding a penalty term equal to the sum of the squared coefficients:
     \[
       \text{Ridge Cost} = \text{RSS} + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2
     \]
   - **Why It Matters**: Helps keep coefficients small, thus reducing variance and risk of overfitting.

3. **Grid Search & Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Grid Search**: Systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance.
   - **Why It Matters**: Hyperparameters (like the penalty term \(\alpha\) in ridge regression) can dramatically impact model performance. Tuning them properly is key to a robust model.

4. **Cross-validation**
   - Splitting the data into multiple folds (segments), training on some folds, and validating on the remaining folds. This process is repeated so each fold serves as the validation set once.
   - **Why It Matters**: Provides a more reliable estimate of out-of-sample performance compared to a single train/test split.
